# Dungeons and Dragons Character Sheet and Game Management Databse System (working title)

For my final project at DigitalCrafts coding Bootcamp I decided to create a website for players of the popular roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons to store and edit their character sheet and basic game/campaign information.

## MVP

Initially it will just be a place for players to manually code in their data, but ultimately I would like to automate as much of the process as possible. For my basic product I will have the options and information available for the creation of a basic character (most likely a Rogue as that is what I am currently playing myself).

## Stretch Goals

Going forward I plan to continue to add as much functionality as I can to the system, adding features for automating a lot of the Dungeon Masters more tedious tasks. Stay tuned for future updates!
